# Physics-Calculator

This is a simple project I started as I learned quantum mechanics and its applications in nanotechnology. There were frequent calculations needed to be done with many physical quantities, such as the speed of light and the mass of an electron. As part of an initiative to facilitate these calculations while improving my coding in Python, this project was created.
